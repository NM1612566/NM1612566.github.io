# About Me
Hello! I am NM1612566.
I am very talented at music and play guitar, cello, piano, and sing. I own a dog and love the beach. I also write songs and am an ambivert. I am very crreative and like writing stories for fun although I have no finished and published works.
My current top career choice is an author because it includes the most of my skill sets, it is the most interesting to me, and my future husband will also have a job so with proper budgeting we will be fine financially. I also already have experience with it so starting out young can give me an advantage for the future. It connects to my lifestyle goals because I want to raise a family and as an author I can easily work from home. It also frees up my flexibility for travel and any activities my kids want to participate in. It also can help me clear my thoughts and my name could potentially end up famous while still being able to live a normal life in public not having to deal with the paparazzi and other challenges that actors, singers, and other famous people have to face since not as many people recognize authorsâ€™ faces unless they are big fans. Skills from this course will help me succeed for my future career because, for example, good project management will help me learn how to better organize my story information and technical skills will help me format and write my stories considering how I write them on computers.
